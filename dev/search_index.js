The Catalyst library for Julia is provided automatically as a precompiled binary by Catalyst_jll.jl at JuliaBinaryWrappers and Yggdrasil.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Getting-started","page":"Home","title":"Getting started","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Prerequisites","page":"Home","title":"Prerequisites","text":"Although the Catalyst API is not restricted to ParaView, this package is geared towards the  ParaView implementation of the Catalyst API. As such ParaView needs to be present on the machine you run your simulation on. In particular, a version is required that ships the Catalyst implementation as a library. On Linux you should look for libcatalyst-paraview.so. Its path has to be set as an environment variable, e.g. by\n\nexport CATALYST_IMPLEMENTATION_PATHS=<path_to_libcatalyst-paraview.so>\n\nAlternatively, when using ParaViewCatalyst.jl from your own application, you can use the keyword argument libpath of the function catalyst_initialize.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Testing","page":"Home","title":"Testing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Catalyst-implementation","page":"Home","title":"Catalyst implementation","text":"Go to the examples folder and start julia using\n\njulia --project=.\n\nIn package mode do\n\n(examples) pkg> dev ..\n(examples) pkg> instantiate\n\nthen\n\njulia> include(\"test_init.jl\")\n\nYou should see some information about the Catalyst implementation.

More verbose output can be enabled by setting the environment variable CATALYST_DEBUG=1.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Paraview","page":"Home","title":"Paraview","text":"Launch ParaView.

Now launch Julia as done before, and execute\n\njulia> include(\"test_execute.jl\")\n\nIn ParaView click on the symbol in front of \"Input\", then click on the symbol in front of \"Extract: input\". You should now see a square. In the properties tab under \"Coloring\", select \"testdata\". Now select \"Catalyst\" from the main menu and \"Continue\". The square should change its color every two seconds.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Using-the-interface","page":"Home","title":"Using the interface","text":"To use ParaViewCatalyst.jl from your code, you only need catalyst_initialize(), catalyst_execute(node), and catalyst_finalize(). All information is passed through Conduit nodes, which are required to adhere to the Blueprint.\n\nA user-defined ParaView pipeline script can be passed to catalyst_initialize using the keyword argument catalyst_pipeline. By default src/catalyst_pipeline.py is used, which activates live visualization. The data can also be viewed on a remote machine. In this case options.CatalystLiveURL has to be adjusted to point to the remote machine. Once a pipeline in ParaView has been set up, it can be exported as a script by selecting \"File\" from the main menu and then \"Save Catalyst State\". It might be required to modify this file afterwards.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Examples","page":"Home","title":"Examples","text":"ParaViewCatalyst.jl is used by Trixi.jl.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Authors","page":"Home","title":"Authors","text":"ParaViewCatalyst.jl was initiated by Jake Bolewski (@jakebolewski) at https://github.com/CliMA and is now maintained by Benedict Geihe (University of Cologne, Germany).","category":"section"},{"location":"#License-and-contributing","page":"Home","title":"License and contributing","text":"ParaViewCatalyst.jl is licensed under the MIT license (see License).
